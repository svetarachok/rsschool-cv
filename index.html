        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>I like challenges and complex projects and always try to grow both personally and within my career. 
          
Having an experience of websites development in past, I realized that the profession of Frontend Developer is exactly what I need. Besides, bring things into action and see the result is a great and motivating thing.  
          That is why I’m here at RS School Frontend Course and will try to do my best to become a skilled specialist.</p>
